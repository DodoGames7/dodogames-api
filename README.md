# dodogames-api
Simple api made for fun using easy-api.ts.

# Story
This api was created back when easy-api.ts was new. At the time of creating it, stuff were experimental and so i was lacking of knowledge to apis that made it hard to create nice endpoints. I decided to maintain this api after leaving it for almost a year now because i had other work on my bots, mainly Dodo-Bot and askers! This api is currently in development so don't expect mush from it.

# Credits
one of the endpoints in the api belongs to either their owner or to easy-api.ts template starters! To check if an api was credited, check the `//` comments at the beginning of each endpoint code.
